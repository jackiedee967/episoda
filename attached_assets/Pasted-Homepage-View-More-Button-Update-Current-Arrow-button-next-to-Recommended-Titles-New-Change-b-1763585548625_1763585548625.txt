Homepage "View More" Button Update
Current: Arrow button next to "Recommended Titles"
New:

Change button text to "View more >"
Make it more visually prominent (ensure it's clearly clickable)
Link to the Explore page


Explore Page Redesign
Goal: Transform the Explore page into a one-stop shop for TV recommendations that combines search functionality with curated content discovery.

Search Functionality:
Default State (before user types):

Show search input box at top
Hide the toggle buttons (Shows, Posts, Comments, Users)
Display curated content sections below (detailed below)

Active State (when user starts typing):

Fade in the toggle buttons (Shows, Posts, Comments, Users)
Display search results as normal
Hide the curated content sections


Curated Content Sections (Default State):
Display content in horizontal scrolling rows, similar to the homepage layout.
Show Display:

Show 2.5 shows visible before scrolling (instead of 1.5 on homepage)
Horizontal scroll for each row


Section Order & Logic:
1. Friend Activity

Shows that user's friends have watched, sorted by number of friends who have watched
Same logic as homepage Friend Activity section
Pull real data from friends' watch activity

2. For You

Most popular shows within user's [Interests] (preferred genres)
Same logic as homepage "Recommended Titles"
API call: Get popular shows filtered by user's interest genres
Sort by popularity within those genres

3. Trending

Shows trending across all genres (not filtered by user interests)
API call: Get trending shows (no genre filter)
Question for API: How does the API determine "trending"? Is it based on recent popularity spike, total views over X days, or another metric? Use whatever the API provides as "trending."

4. Recently Released

Newest popular releases across all genres (not filtered by user interests)
API call: Get recently released shows
Sort by release date
Optionally apply secondary filter for popularity (to avoid showing extremely obscure new releases)

5. Genre Sections (multiple rows, clickable tags)

Display individual genre rows
Clickable genre tags as row titles (use existing genre tag styling)
Order: Show genres from user's [Interests] first at the top, then display all other genres below
Each row shows popular shows within that genre


[Interests] Definition Reminder:
User's [Interests] = Genres from:

Shows selected during signup
Shows they have logged/rated

Use this interest profile to personalize "For You" section.

Visual Layout:
Each section should have:

Section title (e.g., "Friend Activity", "For You", "Trending", genre name)
Genre sections should have clickable genre tags as titles
Horizontal scrolling row of show posters
2.5 shows visible before scroll
