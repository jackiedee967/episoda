Data Persistence & Live Data Implementation

Critical Issue: The app currently has persistence bugs and placeholder data throughout. All data must be real, live, and persistent across sessions.

1. Comments System





All comments must save to database immediately upon posting



Comments must persist after logout/login



Comment count on posts must reflect actual number of comments in database



Delete functionality must work and update counts in real-time

2. Following/Followers





Follow/unfollow actions must save to database immediately



Follower and following counts must update in real-time across the app



When viewing someone's follower/following list, if you follow them or they follow you, YOUR profile should appear at the top of the list



Counts must be accurate everywhere they appear (profile page, user cards, etc.)

3. Mutual Friends Component

Anywhere the "Mutual Friends" component appears (showing profile pictures and count):





Profile pictures must pull from actual user profiles in database



The number displayed must be the accurate count of mutual friends



No placeholder images or fake numbers

4. Playlists/Lists





All lists must persist after creation



Adding/removing items from lists must save immediately



List edits (title, description) must save



Deleting lists must work properly



Lists must remain after logout/login

5. Star Ratings





User ratings must save to database immediately



Ratings must persist after logout/login



User's rating must display correctly when they revisit a show/episode



Rating counts and averages must be calculated from real data

6. Posts & Episode/Show Data





Post counts on episodes and shows must reflect actual number of posts in database



All metrics (likes, comments, ratings) must be real data, not hardcoded numbers

7. Tag Styling Consistency

Tags (show titles, genres, etc.) must have consistent styling across the entire app:





If a show title tag is pink on the feed, it must be pink on the post detail page



If a genre tag is blue and has rounded corners in one place, it must be blue and have rounded corners everywhere



Apply consistent color scheme and styling to all tag types throughout the app

8. General Requirements





All database operations must include proper error handling



Failed saves should show user-friendly error messages



Data should update in real-time without requiring manual refresh where possible



Test all functionality with logout/login to ensure persistence

Testing Checklist

Before marking this complete, test the following flow:





Create account and log in



Follow users, create lists, rate shows, make posts, add comments



Log out completely



Log back in



Verify ALL data from step 2 is still present and accurate



Unfollow someone and verify count updates everywhere



Delete a list and verify it's gone



Check that all numbers (follower counts, post counts, etc.) match actual database records

Priority Level: CRITICAL - This must be completed before any new features are added. The app is non-functional if data doesn't persist.
