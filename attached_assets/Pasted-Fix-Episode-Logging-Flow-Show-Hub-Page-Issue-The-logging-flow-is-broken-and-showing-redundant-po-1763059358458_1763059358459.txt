Fix Episode Logging Flow - Show Hub Page

Issue: The logging flow is broken and showing redundant popups. These flows were working previously but have been rolled back somehow.

CRITICAL: in the future do not change or roll back features that are already working. Once functionality is built and tested, it should remain intact when adding new features. i dont know why this keeps happening. i need to feel confident when we are live with 1M users that you wont break stuff.



There are 2 Logging Flows from Show Hub:

Flow 1: "Log an Episode" Button

Current (broken) behavior:





User clicks "Log an Episode" button on show hub



"Select a Show" popup appears ❌ (WRONG - we already know the show)



Then season/episode dropdown appears



Then review page

Correct behavior:





User clicks "Log an Episode" button on show hub



Season/episode dropdown popup appears immediately (skip "Select a Show" since we're already on that show's page)



User selects season and episode



Review page opens with that show and episode pre-filled

Flow 2: Toggle Episodes from Episodes Tab

Current (broken) behavior:





User opens Episodes tab



User toggles on specific episodes they want to log



Bottom nav changes to "Log X Episodes" button ✓ (this works)



User clicks "Log X Episodes"



"Select a Show" popup appears ❌ (WRONG)



Season/episode dropdowns appear again ❌ (WRONG - already selected)

Correct behavior:





User opens Episodes tab



User toggles on specific episodes they want to log



Bottom nav changes to "Log X Episodes" button ✓



User clicks "Log X Episodes"



Skip directly to review page with the show and selected episodes already pre-filled



No popups - user goes straight to rating/reviewing

Key Requirements:





Both flows should skip the "Select a Show" popup entirely when initiated from a show hub page



Flow 2 should also skip the season/episode selection since episodes are already selected via toggle



The show and episode(s) should be automatically passed to the review page based on context



Do not break or roll back these flows again after fixing them



When a post posts successfully, the user should automativally be redirected to their posts page
