[{"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "I\u2019m creating an app which is like a gen z Letterboxd for TV shows where people can come on, log their shows, see what friends are watching, talk theories and have discussions, and discover new shows to watch. \r\n\r\nLets start by making the homepage. I uploaded a screenshot of how I want the homepage to look and the the vibe of the UI - notice how it is very sleak, modern, and with good padding and margins.\r\n\r\nAs you can see the first main section on the homepage has a bar that says \u201cWhat are you watching? Tell your friends\u201d - this is where you post / log shows. When you click on the button it brings a pop up that slides from the bottom of the page that has a flow where you first select a show (shows the ones you\u2019ve logged before first, and lets you search all shows), then you see a feed of all the episodes (this will be autopopulated from a service like TMBD but put placeholders for now) where you can bulk select the ones you watched (optional), then you add the post details such as a title, text body, rate the epsiode, and then select tags (spoiler alert, fan theory, discussion, episode recap, misc, or type in your own). When anyone posts it shows up in the app in a few places - for example in the \u201cFriend Activity\u201d feed, in the show\u2019s hub (which we will get to later), and on your profile\u2019s feed.\r\n\r\nAll posts have the ability to like, comment, repost, and share (deep link to the app, if possible). The posts show how long ago it was posted. If you click the show poster on the post you go to the Show\u2019s Hub, and if you click on the username in the post it goes to the user\u2019s profile, etc (everything that can be linked out should be).\r\n\r\nOn the \u201cFriend Activity feed if no one has posted give an option to invite friends (which will ask the user to share their contact list, see who is already on the app, and invite others).\r\n\r\nAs the second main section on the homepage under the \u201cwhat are you watching\u201d post bar, there is a Recommended Titles section which shows the top 6 shows and what friends are watching them. If no friends are watching, give recommendations based on what the user has watched before - for example if she has watched reality before recommend other similar reality shows.\r\n\r\nOn the Show\u2019s Hub, it should be a page with a few sections - the main section being a header section with the show\u2019s poster, title, description, rating based on everyone on the app, how many friends are watching or watched it, and total season and episode count.\r\n\r\nBelow this header section has an option to post/log episodes about the show which uses the same post pop up talked about above, but it autoselects/populates the show already.\r\n\r\nThen there should be tabs - Friend activity feed, all activity, and episodes.\r\n\r\nFriend activity feed - all posts/logs of this show from friends (people you follow). Option to sort by hot vs recent. Option to filter by season and episode.\r\nAll activity - same as friend activity but this is all activity from everyone on the app.\r\nEpisodes - this is a tab to see all the seasons and episodes of the show in a list. For each episode you can see the title, brief description preview, total rating, total count of posts/logs associated with it, and the option to log/post about that show. (I am using \u201clog\u201d & \u201cpost\u201d interchangeably because when you log a show / episode it makes a post to the feeds). You can also click into epsiode to see the Episodes Hub, which has a similar layout as the Show Hub, but only shows friend / all activity for that episode."}, {"type": "image", "image": {"filename": "homepage ex.png", "unique_filename": "59e4d593-53e7-4f24-ac6a-4b6a77fdf55c.png", "content_type": "image/png", "file_url": "https://prod-finalquest-user-projects-storage-bucket-aws.s3.amazonaws.com/user-projects/7644d0be-1879-49a1-8f68-d4dae43aebc2/assets/images/59e4d593-53e7-4f24-ac6a-4b6a77fdf55c.png?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAVRUVRKQJC5DISQ4Q&Signature=1oLgq4MA4GQ%2FDNtseQThNK%2BJfZY%3D&Expires=1760495217"}}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I understand!
